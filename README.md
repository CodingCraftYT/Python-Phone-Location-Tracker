# 🌍 Python-Phone-Location-Tracker 📱

GeoPhone is a Python script that empowers you to track the location of any phone number with its country code. 🌐 It utilizes the `phonenumbers` library to extract location and carrier information based on the input phone number. The script then employs the OpenCage Geocoding API to obtain precise latitude and longitude coordinates for the given location and beautifully displays it on an interactive Folium map. 🗺️
